1.1.0
- reworked project structure
- added @JUteTest annotation to mark tests to be started with JUte (provided by the jute-annotations artefact)
- improvements in test result logging
- all tests every time alphabetically sorted in bounds of their order
- added support of parallel execution for tests with the same order value
- tests marked by @JUteTest support JUnit test life cycle - @BeforeClass..@Before..@After..@AfterClass
- added support of 'skipTests' and 'maven.test.skip' properties, like in maven-surefire
- added support of 'jute.test' property to be used from command line, like 'test' in maven-surefire
